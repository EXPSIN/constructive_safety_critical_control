# Controller Parameter Tuning Script
﻿
This repository contains a MATLAB-based script for automating the tuning of controller parameters. The script utilizes symbolic computation to determine the parameters that satisfy the conditions established in the theoretical proofs.
﻿
## Overview
﻿
The script follows a systematic procedure for selecting controller parameters, including system functions, gains, and constants, ensuring that the controller meets the required stability and performance conditions.
﻿
## Requirements
﻿
- MATLAB (tested with version R2023b)
- Symbolic Math Toolbox
﻿
## Script Breakdown
﻿
The script executes the following steps:
﻿
1. **Verify Assumptions**  
The script verifies the necessary assumptions regarding system dynamics and other constants.
﻿
2. **Design Controller**  
It then designs the controller by selecting appropriate parameters to ensure that the system behaves as desired.
﻿
3. **Assign Gain Parameters**  
The script assigns necessary gain parameters to satisfy the system's small-gain conditions for stability.
﻿
4. **Design Recursive Controller**  
Based on the parameters selected, it recursively designs the controller for each subsystem to meet tracking and stability requirements.
﻿
## Usage
﻿
### 1. Edit User-Defined Items
The script requires you to define certain parameters. These are marked with `[User-Defined]` comments in the code. Review and update these values based on your system specifications.
﻿
### 2. Run the Script
Once the necessary parameters are defined, simply run the script in MATLAB. It will automatically calculate the required controller gains and display the results.
